                <h3>History and Origin of the Teduray</h3>
                <p>The history of the Teduray is shared by the Maguindanao, that until the coming of Islam in Mindanao roughly five and a half centuries ago, the Maguindanao and the Teduray were one and the same people. These two peoples were believed that they came from two brothers, Mamalu and Tabunaway. According to this legend, when Sharif Kabungsuan came to teach Islam, Mamalu, the elder brother refused to be converted while the younger brother, Tabunaway, embraced the Islamic faith. With this major turn in their lives, the brothers made a pact that Mamalu would go to the mountains and Tabunaway will make his living near the lowlands and the delta of the big river, now known as the Rio Grande de Mindanao, and that they would trade. The brothers went their separate ways with their respective followers. This separation happened around 1300 AD. From the elder brother, came the Teduray and Dulangan Manobo and from the younger brother came the Maguindanao. </p>
                <p>
                    Historically, institutionalized trading pacts did exist between the Teduray Baglalan (headsmen or tribal title holders) and the Maguindanao datus of the coastal area and valley. During the pre-spanish period, a system of trade between the Teduray, Dulangan Manobo and Maguindanao flourished. The former traded tobacco, beeswax, rattan, gutta percha, (sap of a tree the Teduray called Tefedus use as ingredients for insulation materials), almaciga and crops. The Maguindanao traded clothing materials, iron tools and salt. This trading relationship may have originated from the early ties of these peoples based on the legend. During this time, the people of the Cotabato river basin had been won over to Islam which had established a Sultanate all over Maguindanao. Based on later developments it seems that this trading arrangement with the Maguindanao has inhabited the development of manufacturing among the Teduray. Very much unlike the other peoples in Mindanao the Tedurays have no pottery or metal works. These basic needs were secured through the trading system with the Maguindanao.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spanish influence in the area occupied by the Teduray came rather late. It was only sometime in the 19th century towards the end of the Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines that the central government in Manila and the Roman Catholic church were able to establish a stronghold in Cotabato, while a Jesuit school and mission were built near Awang close to the mountain ranges. The Spaniards were able to convert a number of Tedurays to Catholicism. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The outbreak of war between the American occupation forces and the Muslim people of Mindanao in the early part of the 1900s signaled the beginning of another phase of colonization. The Americans through the efforts of a Philippine Constabulary Officer named Irving Edwards who married a Teduray built a school in Upi in 1919. The building of roads which ran into the Teduray territory opened up the region to numerous lowland Christian settlers most of them Ilocano and Visayan and Upi valley became the site of many homesteads. The Americans introduced the idea of titling lands as homesteads. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A significant number of Tedurays were persuaded to give up their traditional slash-and-burn methods of cultivation and they shifted to farming with plow and carabao. This was the beginning of the dichotomy in Teduray culture: many Teduray refused to be acculturated and retreated deeper into their ancestral mountain habitat, while others resettled in the Upi valley and became peasants. Many of the resettled and modernized Teduray have been converted to Christianity, as a result of years of evangelization work by “clergy who are either American missionaries Filipinos from Luzon or profoundly westernized Teduray” (Schlegel 1970:9). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the centuries of fighting between the Spaniards and the Moro people, some of the latter fled to the neighboring heights and joined the Teduray there. The Spaniards and later the Americans, sought to contain Moro influence by making the Teduray Christian and sedentary through missions and schools and protected them with soldiery. They also established plantations along the coast and used Teduray labor on them. Since the 1900 Christian Filipino colonists, land speculators and logging interests have entered the Teduray uplands along with Chinese storekeepers in the valley.  
                </p>
                    Today the Teduray share a common fate with the many ethnic peoples in Mindanao. The rapid changes in their social and physical environment brought about by the onslaught of different cultures have changed their way of life. To the Tedurays who have settled in the valleys and have maintained intense contact with lowlanders, both Christians and Muslims have been acculturated. Their adoption of sedentary agriculture has necessarily drawn them deeper into the market and cash economy typical of the rural economy of the entire country. This group of Teduray are now peasantized (Schlegel 1970). Peasants are rural yet live in relation to market systems, and some larger system of larger stratification, to urban centers – even metro capitals and they constitute part societies with part cultures (Krober 1948:284). Although they still have some loyalty to their distinctive ethnic identity, they have become constituent elements of some larger political integration and usually, must speak some language other than their own to get along in the larger social whole which their society is merely a part. Many of them have accessed education and a number of them have settled in the cities and nearby provinces to seek greener pastures. Little by little they are aspiring for leading roles in local governance although they still constitute the constituency of those Maguindanao who have through the years made their presence felt in the local politics.
                <p>
                    A glaring contrast are those Teduray who refused to embrace the changes and are now forced to go deeper in the mountains due to the onslaught of logging and other economic interests.

                <h3>Territorial Claim, Physical Occupancy Account and Genealogy </h3>
                <p>
                    The Teduray have occupied the same area for several centuries, even if they have undergone varying degrees of assimilation and acculturation. Who are the Tedurays? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Teduray are an animistic, swidden farming people who live in the northern reaches of the Cotabato cordillera in southwestern Mindanao. The Teduray differ physically, linguistically and culturally from the Maguindanao of the Cotabato valley and to the north and east and from the Manobo, who have beyond the Tran river to the south. There are slight differences in these respects among the Tedurays themselves, who differentiate three sub-groups: the river people, the coast people and the mountain people. Linguistically, they are Malayo-Polynesian, according to the classification of Conkin (1956) along with the Tagabli and Bilaan. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The present habitat of the Teduray constitutes a small portion of their ancestral domain. The Teduray account to the long history of its physical occupation which dates back even before the advent of Islam in the Philippines in the 12th century. Tracing their roots from Mamalu, the Teduray traced occupancy to as far as Awang and PC Hill in the north, occupying large portions of the Cotabato city and then stretches far to Dinaig down to the west, the Tran river in the south straddling its boundary with the Manobo and the coast of Illana bay on the east. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Providing solid support to its occupancy account and ancestral land claim is the genealogy of the Teduray whose continuity traced the generations who have handed down their territory since time immemorial. The genealogy provides convincing proof that the Teduray have actually lived there for centuries.

                <h3>Teduray World View on Land</h3>
                <p>
                    To understand the Teduray concept on land necessitates a deeper insight into its view on property or use right. This can be gleaned from the Teduray word gefe which roughly corresponds to having exclusive rights to something over its present use. According to Schlegel, to be gefe of something is when a person has not only an emotional or even economic interest on any object, person or even a ceremony but also a legitimate personal oversight. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use of land for the Teduray applies the same concept directly in the sense of right of usufruct. A swidden belongs to a person who is gefe until after harvest time during which the sight is lain to fallow and that person is no longer gefe over the site. Once it has been publicly marked through community rituals, a land selected by an individual for a swidden is free for his use. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the Teduray, the right to use the swidden site is not hereditary. After a single cropping cycle the site reverts to public domain and cannot be inherited by descendants. Swidden cultivation is a system of agriculture practiced by the Teduray and guarantees a member of the tribe the right to use the land within a whole cropping cycle. After fallowing, when the forest vegetation has been restored the site is again free to anyone who may select it as his swidden for that cropping cycle. In this context the Teduray concept of land utilization is inextricably linked with their concept of use right. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a marked contrast with the present context. The system of land ownership of the national government as stipulated in government laws has forced the Teduray to give up the land concept which has sustained the tribe for generations.

                <p>
                    he Teduray are a traditional hill people of southwestern Mindanao. They live in the upper portion of a river-drained area in the north-western part of Cotabato, where the mountainous terrain of the Cotabato Cordillera faces the Celebes sea. The Teduray call themselves etew teduray or Teduray people but also classify themselves according to their geographical location: etew rotor, mountain people; etew dogot, coastal people; etew tran, for those living along the Tran river; and etew Ufi for those who live within and near the town center. 
                </p>    
                <p>
                    According to the latest census, there are about 200,000 Tedurays. The Teduray are Malay in physical features and their language is structurally related to those of the Malayo-Polynesian family (Schlegel 1970:5). 
                </p>
                <h4>Myth on Creation: </h4>
                <p>
                    The creation myth centers around a female deity called Minaden, who shaped the world and the first creatures living on it. She fashioned human beings from mud. Having done this, she placed the sun between the earth and the sky and brought forth daylight. The world is believed to be divided into eight layers, the topmost layers occupied by Tulus, who was Minaden’s brother. The Tulus was also known by other names, such as Meketefu and Sualla. The first two human beings created by Minaden begun to grow, but after sometime, they had not yet begotten any offspring. Meketefu came down from the skyworld and saw that the male reproductive organ was as small as a tiny red pepper, and that of the female was as big as a snail shell. Furthermore, their noses were upside down and whenever it rained, they caught water, making two human beings sick. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meketefu decided to create his own clay figures of a man and woman. Using an old bolo, he struck the female figure, wounding her where the legs joined together. As he did so, the handle of the bolo flew off and struck to the middle part of the male clay figure. He also turned their noses right side up, so they would not take in rainwater. Soon after, the two creatures were able to bring forth a child into the world. But no food was available to nourish themselves and the child eventually died. But the world had no soil and the child could not be buried. And so the father begged the god Meketefu to give them soil. Much later, various types of vegetation sprouted from the plot of the earth where the child was buried. One part of the plot gave forth plants and lime for chewing. The hands turned into bananas, the nails into nuts, the teeth into corn, the brains into lime, the bones into cassava, and the ears into betel leaf (Patanne 1977:256 and Wood 1957:15-16).

                <h3>Genealogical Survey</h3>
                <p>The ancestors of the Teduray and Dulangan Manobo were brothers Mamalu and Tabunaway and their sister Salabanun. They were the known chieftains in Central Mindanao upon the arrival of the famous Muslim missionary Sharif Mohammad Kabungsuan estimated by many scholars to have taken place between 1450-1475 AD.</p>
                <p>The Mamalu-Tabunaway history is popular among the different ethnic groups of the Moro and the Indigenous Peoples in Central Mindanao, though told in several versions. Common among these stories is that Mamalu remained faithful to his traditional ways of life, while his brother Tabunaway embraced Islam and the new system of governance introduced by Sharif Kabungsuan. This incident led to the historical separation of the two brothers and their followers, sealed with a SAFA or pact:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Respect and recognition of one's territory and system of self-governance</li>
                    <li>Continued circulation of economic activities</li>
                    <li>Respect and recognition of one's custom, tradition, and culture</li>
                    <li>Unity against a common enemy</li>
                    <li>Everlasting treatment as brothers and sisters including the generations to come</li>
                </ul>
                <p>From then on, the Mamalu descendants scattered throughout their claimed territories, starting from Tuduk Tawan-tawan where the Teduray tribe descended and Banobo where the Manobo tribes descended, stretching to the mountain ranges in the south sometimes referred to as Teduray and Manobo mountain ranges, down to the coastal areas west of the mountain ranges.</p>
                <p>After Mamalu, the Teduray leadership from Tuduk Tawan-tawan (presently known as PC Hill in Cotabato City) continued to grow, now led by Lagey Duloyon, who took Kibleg as the center of his leadership in partnership with Galaan, Chief Justice Officer based at Balalaen. On the other hand, the Manobo expanded from Banubo to Kawran, now led by datu Dulangan, the same ancestor the Dulangan Manobo claimed as the origin of their tribe. Datu Dulangan ended his reign at Sugud Dulangan, a place now found at Barangay Tubak, Ampatuan, Maguindanao.</p>
                <p>The present generation of the Teduray and Dulangan Manobo are now scattered throughout the territory traditionally occupied by clans but now mixed even with settlers.</p>

                <h4>Lambangian</h4>
                <p>Lambangian is a tribe that traced their roots to the historic war between the Teduray and Dulangan Manobo hundreds of years ago in a place called Binusugan near the Tran river, now called Barangay Villamonte in Lebak, Sultan Kudarat Province. The tribal war was caused by the kidnapping of Dulangan Manobo experts in collecting honey bees by the Teduray and selling them to the Maguindanaon to serve as slaves in honey collection for sale to Chinese traders.</p>
                <p>The tribal war lasted for ten cropping seasons, or equivalent to ten years of conflict. The Teduray warriors came from as far as Bantek, Senigang, and Balalaen, while the Dulangan Manobo warriors came from Buyaan, Mrawir, and upper Tran. Both parties suffered casualties, which was only neutralized when a long drought or “lenggob” inflicted damage to the agricultural areas of both the Dulangan Manobo and Teduray.</p>
                <p>Aware of the abundance of food at Tuduk Mrawir, a Teduray Chieftain and his family crossed the war-torn areas of Binusugan to Mrawir to look for food. Successfully reaching Tuduk Mrawir, the Chieftain explained to Datu Midtu the negative effects of the war and the lenggob. The two leaders concluded that God punished them for engaging in tribal war, and they decided to stop the conflict.</p>
                <p>The negotiation was sealed with the inter-marriage of four young men and women from both the Teduray and Dulangan Manobo as a symbol of unity and oneness. This was concluded with a ritual and prayer calling the coming offspring of the newlywed men and women as LAMBANGIAN, meaning the crossbreed of the Teduray and Dulangan Manobo. Since then, no war between the Teduray and Dulangan Manobo has occurred.</p>
