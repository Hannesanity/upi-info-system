                    <h3>Teduray Culture</h3>
                    <p>The Teduray are an Indigenous People who live in Maguindanao Province, Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Philippines. Teduray Peoples have a tradition that when a baby is born, the umbilical cord is placed in a biton (basket) and hung on a tree branch. The bearer of the cord whispers to the tree a prayer that the child being born may grow as strong and sturdy as the tree and the forest where it grows, and as rooted to the earth. This practice also known as semedang fused, the umbilical cord with a piece of ginger, and a chunk of charcoal is wrapped with a white cloth, and placed into the biton on a tree branch that face east. </p>
                    <p>Teduray Peoples have a spiritual belief that views every birth as two sets of twins, consisting of the baby and its umbilical cord. The baby and the cord each have lowoh (bodies) and remogor (souls), but only the baby has a ferenawa (breath-string). Unable to breathe, the umbilical cord twin does not survive after birth. During the labor process, the mother is assisted by a fanday (midwife) to ensure that she delivers safely. Today, the tradition of hanging a baby's umbilical cord onto a tree branch is no longer practiced, and has shifted to the planting of a tree instead. </p>
                    <p>The traditional role of fanday has changed dramatically in recent times. In 2008, the government imposed the Maternal, Newborn and Child Health and Nutrition Strategy (colloquially known as the No Home Birthing policy), which transferred the role traditionally occupied by Indigenous fanday to professional midwives. Enforcement of this policy means that people must go to a medical center to give birth, even if it is very far from their home, to avoid costly fines. Women who give birth at home and any persons assisting her face fines of up to 2,000 PHP (around $36). In the event of either the death of the mother or baby, the fanday will be fined an additional 5,000 PHP. If they can not pay the fine, they face up to six months in prison.

                        <p>October is recognized as National Indigenous Peoples Month in the Philippines, a time dedicated to honoring and raising awareness about the rich cultural heritage and contributions of indigenous communities. This observance aims to foster greater appreciation among Filipinos for the diverse and vibrant traditions of these groups, which make up at least 10% of the population in many developing countries, including the Philippines. With over 50 distinct indigenous cultural communities in the archipelago, each group offers unique artistic expressions, knowledge systems, and sustainable practices that have been passed down through generations.</p>

                    <h3>Sulagad Farming System</h3>
                    <img src="img/sulagad.png" alt="Sulagad Image" class="mb-3" />
                    <p><strong>Sulagad</strong> is an indigenous concept of food sovereignty practiced by the Teduray and Lambangian tribes. It emphasizes organic farming methods as an alternative to chemical-based products, preserving the land's natural fertility and ensuring the well-being of the community.</p>
                    <h4>Components of Sulagad</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Minor crops like vegetables and root crops</li>
                        <li>Permanent crops like coconut, coffee, and fruits</li>
                        <li>Animal husbandry and poultry-raising</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This system covers the basic needs of food, health, education, shelter, and clothing. It provides organically grown food, ensures good health, supports education through trade, and maintains resources for building shelter and clothing.</p>
                    <p>Sulagad faces threats from modern agricultural practices introduced in the 1990s, which have harmed farmlands and forests. Climate change and market forces have also affected agricultural production, causing uncertainty in food security.</p>
                    <p>The Timuay Justice and Governance, the indigenous political structure of the Teduray and Lambangian tribes, has strengthened the Sulagad system as an alternative to chemical farming and genetically modified organisms. With support from NGOs, sustainable agriculture trainings have been conducted, promoting ecological balance for present and future generations.

                    <h3>DXUP-Peace Radio</h3>
                    <p>DXUP-Peace Radio, established in 2004, plays a vital role in fostering communication and peace among the tri-people community of Upi. With its focus on values formation and cultural promotion, it has become an essential part of local governance and community engagement.</p>
                    <p>The local government recognized the value of communicating with its citizens and initially paid a radio station in Cotabato City for a program. The opportunity for its own station came through the GenPeace project. The municipality committed P500,000 to establish the community radio, serving as an advocacy center, a radio for peace, and a venue for elevating people's concerns. The station, named DXUP FM, was inaugurated on February 8, 2004. It does not have commentary programs but focuses on values formation and promoting tri-people's culture.</p>
                    <p>A Community Media Education Council (CMEC) was formed to manage the station, which is run by volunteers. The station is mainly funded by the local government, which provides the site, building, and transmitter, and trained volunteers in programming and technical operations. DXUP FM also receives donations and minor income from public service announcements and sponsorships.</p>
                    <p>The station runs weekly programs from 5 am to 9 pm, covering news, barangay affairs, moral values, and livelihood programs. During elections, it offers live coverage and educates listeners on the electoral process. DXUP FM covers local events and celebrations, continuously updating its programs based on public demand.</p>
                    <p>The primary benefit of DXUP FM is providing a direct communication link between the government and people, promoting transparency and community participation. It includes discussions on people's rights and culture, bridging cultural gaps. DXUP FM faces challenges like rising expectations, logistical needs, equipment deterioration, and volunteer retention. The station remains dependent on local government support, which could impact its independence and operations in the future.</p>

                    <p>Timuay Justice and Governance (TJG), also known as Kēsēfanangguwit Timuay, is the ancient governance system and leadership practiced by the Tëduray and Lambangian Indigenous Peoples of South Central Mindanao. Although it is not a government entity, it is recognized by the Philippine government under RA 8371 (IPRA) and by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) as a legitimate Indigenous Political Structure (IPS).</p>
                    
                    <h4>Customary Laws</h4>
                    <p>The law implemented by TJG is composed of Customary Laws: Ukit, Tëgudon, and Dowoy. TJG respects and adheres to the laws, decrees, and regulations of the state while maintaining its own indigenous governance practices.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Structure</h4>
                    <h5>As a Governance System and Leadership Title</h5>
                    <p>Timfada Limud (Tribal Congress) is the highest decision-making body, with delegates chosen from different villages and branches of governance. The Supreme Council of Chieftains (Mintéd sa Ingéd - MSI) serves as the policy-making body, with the Executive Council (Sulang Timfada Limud - STL) handling day-to-day operations. TJG also includes various titles based on specific tasks and functions.</p>
                    
                    <h5>In the Ingëd Level (Traditional Territory)</h5>
                    <p>TJG's structure includes the Ingëd (traditional territory) and Fënuwo (villages). Modern adaptations like the Rëmfing Fënuwo (Cluster of Villages) address displacement and fragmentation due to armed conflicts.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Historical Background</h4>
                    <p>TJG faced suppression from the arrival of the Sultanate system, Spanish colonization, and the American period. Despite this, the system continued in a clandestine manner. It was officially revived with the approval of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act (IPRA) of 1997. The TJG re-emerged through the 1st Timfada Limud in 2002, ensuring the preservation of indigenous governance and cultural heritage.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Today's TJG</h4>
                    <p>Currently, TJG is based on the unified Fusaka Ingëd of the Tëduray and Lambangian, including areas outside the traditional territory. It continues to practice and operationalize Customary Laws, ensuring the well-being and cultural identity of the indigenous communities.</p>

                    <p>Monom is the Teduray weaving tradition. A Teduray household is easily distinguished by the presence of traditional baskets, the most common of which is the “biton”. These baskets are used for storing harvested corn, rice, vegetables, and other crops. The same basket, when covered, is called a “senafeng” and is used to store seeds and rice grains. The bilao or winnow basket in the Teduray dialect is called a tefaya.</p>

                    <h4>Weaving Process</h4>
                    <p>The main material used is “pawa,” a variety of bamboo. For basket rims, “teel” or rattan is used, and to sew the rim, “nito,” a vine, is used. The process of stripping the nito into equal diameters is called “sangaten.” Bamboo is harvested on moonless days to prevent dry rot and extend its useful life.</p>

                    <h4>Buring (Dye)</h4>
                    <p>Buring is a dye made from soot, often burnt rubber, mixed with the sap of camote leaves, which acts as a fixative. This dye is used to color bamboo strips.</p>

                    <h4>Basket and Hat Weaving</h4>
                    <p>The Tedurays have specific names for each part of a basket or woven hat (safyaf), the weaving process, and the different designs they make. Some designs are taboo and believed to bring bad luck, while others can only be executed under specific circumstances.</p>

                    <h4>Sayaf</h4>

                    <p>Sayaf is a Teduray word for hat. It is made of indigenous materials such as bamboo, nito, and rattan. Sayaf was once used solely by a Timuay (Chieftain) but is now widely sold in local markets.</p>

                    <h3>Beliefs</h3>
                    <p>Indigenous beliefs and practices among the Tirurays are primarily animistic. Over time, influences from neighboring Muslim Maguindanao, Roman Catholics, and Episcopalian churches have shaped their spiritual landscape. While some Tirurays have converted to Islam or Christianity, many still adhere to their traditional animistic customs and rituals.</p>
                    <p>Tiruray knowledge of Christianity comes mainly from Roman Catholics, with additional influences from Episcopalians and other religious groups. Many Tirurays have moved away from animistic beliefs, with several becoming Christians, and some have established Tiruray churches with Tiruray pastors.</p>
